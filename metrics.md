# 📊 Quantitative Performance Metrics  
### Algo-Quant-Backtester — Strategy Evaluation Reference

This document describes the full suite of professional quantitative metrics used to evaluate algorithmic trading strategies inside this project. These metrics reflect real-world practices from:

- Quant research teams  
- HFT shops  
- Hedge funds  
- Institutional backtesting frameworks  
- ML-based forecasting pipelines  

---

# 📈 1. Cumulative Return (Total Return)

**Definition:**  
The total percentage gain/loss over the entire backtest.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Cumulative Return} = \prod_{t=1}^{T}(1 + r_t) - 1
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Higher is better.  
Shows overall profitability.

---

# 📉 2. Volatility (Standard Deviation of Returns)

**Definition:**  
Measures how “risky” or volatile the strategy is.

**Formula:**  
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(r_t)}
\]

**Interpretation:**  
- Low volatility = smoother equity curve  
- High volatility = more uncertainty  

---

# ⚖️ 3. Sharpe Ratio

**Definition:**  
Return relative to volatility.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Sharpe} = \frac{R - R_f}{\sigma}
\]

Where:  
- \( R \) = Strategy return  
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate (e.g., US T-Bills)  
- \( \sigma \) = Standard deviation of returns

**Interpretation:**  
- > 1.0 → Good  
- > 1.5 → Very good  
- > 2.0 → Institutional-grade  

---

# 📉 4. Sortino Ratio (Downside-Risk Sharpe)

**Definition:**  
Sharpe but penalizes only *downside* volatility.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Sortino} = \frac{R - R_f}{\sigma_{\text{downside}}}
\]

**Interpretation:**  
More realistic than Sharpe for ML strategies.  
A strategy may have high volatility but good upward moves — Sortino reflects that.

---

# 📉 5. Max Drawdown (MDD)

**Definition:**  
Largest peak-to-trough loss.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Min Equity Curve Value} - \text{Max Prior Peak}}{\text{Max Prior Peak}}
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Lower absolute value is better.  
Example:  
- -10% = very good  
- -25% = acceptable  
- -50% = high risk  

---

# 📆 6. CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)

**Definition:**  
Annualized return over the entire backtest.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{CAGR} = (1 + R)^{\frac{1}{\text{years}}} - 1
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Normalizes performance across strategies with different backtest durations.

---

# 💵 7. Win Rate

**Definition:**  
Percentage of trades that are profitable.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Win Rate} = \frac{\text{Winning Trades}}{\text{Total Trades}}
\]

**Interpretation:**  
High win rate does *not* guarantee profitability — expectancy matters.  
(A 90% win rate scalper can still blow up.)

---

# 💡 8. Expectancy (Average Return Per Trade)

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Expectancy} = P(win) \cdot Avg(win) - P(loss) \cdot Avg(loss)
\]

**Interpretation:**  
This is the **single most important** metric in ML-based trading models.

---

# 📉 9. Equity Curve

Generated by compounding returns:

\[
E_t = E_{t-1} \cdot (1 + r_t)
\]

Used to visualize:

- Trend  
- Volatility  
- Drawdowns  
- Stability
